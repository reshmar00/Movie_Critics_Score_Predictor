# Movie_Critics_Score_Predictor
The Movie Criticsâ€™ Score Predictor combines web scraping, machine learning, and web development to estimate critics' scores for movies. This project has provided me with valuable experience in working with new frameworks and libraries, such as Flask for web development, and managing databases with MySQL. I will be leveraging Hugging Face's transformers for generating text embeddings. These embeddings will be used in a regression model to predict critics' scores, enhancing my skills in developing robust and interactive web applications with advanced NLP techniques.
